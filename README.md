# AIDevs.pl Repository - Third Edition - Python Version

This repository contains the code and solutions for the third edition of the AIDevs program, designed to integrate Generative AI with application logic, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and advanced automation techniques to create autonomous AI Agents.

**Note**: The original AIDevs content is writen using JavaScript. This repository adapts all tasks and finds sollutions in Python, making it accessible to Python developers to follow the course objectives.
